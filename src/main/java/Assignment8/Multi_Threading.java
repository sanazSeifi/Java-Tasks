    * 1- Thread is small portion of process and that's why we call that light-weight process. It is basic unit of CPU Utilization.
    * Each program associate 1 or more processes and each process may execute 1 or more Threads(Traditional Thread and multiple Thread.
    * different between Process and Thread:
    * context switch is more heavy in process than Thread.
    * process don't share memory but Thread can share memory with peer memory
    * more time for communication between processes but let time between Threads
    * If process locked the other processes can execute but if a Thread block the peer Threads will block as well.
    * processes are independent but Threads are dependent of each other
    * Processes get more time for creation and termination but threads less time.
    * We use Thread because (Multi-Thread) to perform more than one task at a time.
